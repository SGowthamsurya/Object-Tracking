# Object-Tracking
Object Tracking using YOLO
**Introduction:**

  This project implements an object tracking system using Raspberry Pi as the central processing unit and Arduino to control the servo motors. The Raspberry Pi processes the input from a camera module to detect and track objects, while the Arduino handles motor control for real-time movement.

  

**Features:**

  Object Detection & Tracking: Uses computer vision techniques to identify and follow objects.
  
  Servo Motor Control: Arduino controls servo motors to adjust the camera position based on tracking input.
  
  Raspberry Pi as Processing Unit: Handles image processing and decision-making.
  
  Arduino as Actuator Controller: Manages servo movements efficiently.

  

**Components Used:**

  Raspberry Pi (any model with camera support)
  
  Arduino (Uno/Nano)
    
  Servo Motors
  
  Camera Module/USB Webcam
  
  Power Supply and Jumper Wires

  

**How It Works:**

  The camera module/USB Webcam captures live video.

  Raspberry Pi processes the video stream and detects the object.
  
  Based on the objectâ€™s movement, Raspberry Pi sends commands to the Arduino.
  
  The Arduino adjusts the servo motors to follow the object's position.
  
  The system continuously updates to track the object's movement in real-time.

  

**Future Improvements:**

  Implementing AI-based tracking for enhanced accuracy.
  
  Adding multiple camera support.
  
  Wireless communication between Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
